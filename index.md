I am a Senior AI Engineer at [Staples](https://www.staples.com/) AI Innovation Lab, where I lead machine learning projects focused on 1) embedding and reranking models and product matching systems; 2) agentic AI commerce and 3) GenAI enterprise workflows.

I received my Ph.D. in Materials Science and Engineering from [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/), where I worked on computational methods including DFT and GW-BSE calculations.

<!-- My research interests include embedding models, contrastive learning, and distributed ML systems. -->
